</ul>
<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>GitHub's version control capability is something that can be used in multiple disciplines (obvious ones being coding and programming, less obvious is something ilke a thesis draft). GitHub by itself is a bit of an awkward tool to use (GUI and the fact that Windows OS are not inheirantly git or bash friendly), which is why Codeanywhere is also particularly useful. Being able to access the same files across OS platform is very important to me since I work on two different OS with my UNC laptop (Windows) and my private laptop (Ubuntu).</p>
<h1 id="what-tools-have-been-the-most-difficult-to-learn">What tools have been the most difficult to learn?</h1>
<ul>
<li>HTML5</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-have-they-been-particularly-difficult-to-learn-and-use">Why have they been particularly difficult to learn and use?</h2>
<p>This course is not actually the beginning of when I started to learn HTML/HTML5, but out of everything we have encountered so far, it remains to be more difficult than the rest. Initally it was remembering how to write and read HTML, then later it was correctly implementing some parts of it (images in particular have been annoying to set up).</p>
<h2 id="what-tools-would-you-like-to-learn-more-about">What tools would you like to learn more about?</h2>
<p>Definitely more with git, GitHub, and Codeanywhere. Learning more about Jekyll and VIM would also be pretty neat (and I probably will start studying it on my own time).</p>

<p><strong><em>When you are finished with the questions in file:</em></strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I want you to change the name of the file to your GitHub username.</li>
<li>You will then work as a group to convert the file to HTML, DOCX, and ODT formats, per the instructions in class.</li>
<li>Then I want you to add, commit, and push your changes.</li>
<li>Finally, you will create a pull request in GitHub to get these files back into my original repository.</li>
</ol>
